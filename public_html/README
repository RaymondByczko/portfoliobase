The collection of directories and files associated with this
README are for a website at HOME_URL/portfolio.  An index.php
file at that path represents the home page of the website.

The website is constructed such that HOME_URL/portfolio references
other URLs under HOME_URL, like HOME_URL/mylayouts.  The idea is
that HOME_URL/portfolio represents a big bucket that the developer
can put his/her web work into.

Additions to that bucket are developed in general by sequential
means, and then 'added' to the bucket.  This addition process
is by modifying the javascript menu structure that is present.
